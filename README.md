# atcoder-refactor

Rewrites variable names in AtCoder problem statements.

Some problems on AtCoder abuse confusing naming for variables, such as *A*, *B*, *C* and *D*. You can rewrite variable names by this plugin, then use the names in your code without remembering which name in the code corresponds to which variable in the problem.
